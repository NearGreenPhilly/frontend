Fork of front end files from Food Oasis LA, for NearGreenPhilly to work with. (August 2017)
Goal 1: Is their react/redux based front end something we can adapt, or should we stick to the simpler HTML/CSS/JavaScript of our first version.

### Components vs. Views vs. Layouts

**TL;DR:** They're all components.

This distinction may not be important for you, but as an explanation: A **Layout** is something that describes an entire page structure, such as a fixed navigation, viewport, sidebar, and footer. Most applications will probably only have one layout, but keeping these components separate makes their intent clear. **Views** are components that live at routes, and are generally rendered within a **Layout**. What this ends up meaning is that, with this structure, nearly everything inside of **Components** ends up being a dumb component.
